GloriousTaskHelp: On-Demand Task Service Platform
Overview: GloriousTaskHelp is an innovative on-demand service platform that connects customers with service providers for a wide variety of tasks. From household chores to professional consulting, GloriousTaskHelp offers a seamless, AI-powered platform that matches users with the right helpers based on specific needs. The applicationâ€™s intelligent matching algorithm, coupled with a user-friendly interface, ensures that users save time and access reliable help at an affordable price. As a product manager for this venture, I played a key role in shaping its strategy, from market research to operational implementation, and driving its growth.

Key Responsibilities:

Strategic Planning: Defined the product vision, goals, and market opportunities, aligning the business with customer needs. Identified a clear market gap, particularly among busy professionals, parents, students, and elderly individuals who needed reliable and affordable help.

User Stories & Requirements: Led the development of user stories, business requirements, and functional specifications to ensure the product met the diverse needs of users and service providers. Worked with developers to map out features like task matching, service booking, and secure payment options.

Prototype Development: Oversaw the creation of a clean, intuitive prototype, which included diverse service categories such as errands, beauty services, and eldercare. Ensured that the product was designed with scalability and ease of use in mind, taking feedback from initial beta tests to improve user experience.

AI Integration: Spearheaded the integration of an AI assistant, "Gloria," that enhanced task matching by filtering service providers based on location, ratings, cost, and availability. This resulted in a more personalized experience for users.

Go-to-Market Strategy: Created a comprehensive marketing strategy to target key demographics (18-65 years old) and implemented customer acquisition tactics such as digital marketing, influencer campaigns, and referral programs. Focused on acquiring customers through social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

Customer Retention: Developed a tiered subscription model to incentivize repeat users, offering rewards, priority booking, and discounts for frequent bookings. Ensured long-term engagement through loyalty programs and customer support initiatives.

Operations & Scalability: Managed the operational strategy to ensure smooth performance and rapid scalability, including cloud computing and integrations with third-party APIs. Monitored performance metrics and user feedback to optimize both the product and customer service processes.
